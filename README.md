# Career-Canvas

## Description

• Welcome to my website showcasing responsive layout design! This site was meticulously crafted, to the best of my current ability, to adapt seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a good viewing experiences for all users. As a portfolio piece, it highlights my ability to creating user-friendly designs that prioritize accessibility and functionality.

Using semantic elements and advanced CSS techniques like flexbox control, I've structured the page for ease of navigation. Each section is tagged to enable smooth scrolling and quick access to relevant content, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

Viewing my site on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device should create a friendly experience with fluid layouts and dynamic elements that adjust to multiple screen sizes. This portfolio is a showcase of my current abilities and sklills regarding responsive designs.

Additionally, I decided to go outside the scope of the project to learn more as my interest was peeked around certain areas. This is in regard to the icon controls and multiple responsive states that I think add to user experience and legibility.

I spent some time using differing color palletes and icons to attempt to style the page rather than having a simple white or black background.

I was met with challenges using flexboxes in addition to gradiants and color controlers.
Ultimately, I wasn't able to achieve full artistic vision within this project but I have certainly learned more than I could previously and will be applying this knowledge to future endevours.
